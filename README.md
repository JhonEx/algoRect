### Rectangle Algorithm for Nuvalence hiring process.

### __Development:__
1. It does include following methods:
1. Intersetion: You must be able to determine whether two rectangles have one or more interseting lines and produce a result idenƟfying the points of intersecƟon. For your convenience, the scenario is diagrammed.
2. Containment: You must be able to determine whether a rectangle is wholly contained within another rectangle. For your convenience, the scenario is diagrammed in Appendix 2.
3. Adjacency: Implement the ability to detect whether two rectangles are adjacent. Adjacency is defined as the sharing of at least one side. Side sharing may be proper, sub-line or parƟal. A
   sub-line share is a share where one side of rectangle A is a line that exists as a set of points wholly contained on some other side of rectangle B, where parƟal is one where some line segment on a side of rectangle A exists as a set of points on some side of Rectangle B. For your convenience,
   these scenarios are diagrammed in Appendix 3
